# Scheduler	

The scheduler project is a demonstration project used to investigate and understand class method overrides.

The intention is to write a scheduler similar to the one used in WPILib. 

The scheduler runs the default command for each registered subsystem. 

Sounds simple? Follow along the commits as we build the scheduler.

In the mean time, the scheduler will be developed 

* using TDD with Google Test (`gtest`) and Google Mock (`gmock`)
* Injection as appropriate
